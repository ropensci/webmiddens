simple caching of HTTP requests/responses, hooking into webmockr (https://github.com/ropensci/webmockr)
for the HTTP request matching

### the need

- `vcr` is meant really for testing, or script use. i don't think it fits
well into a use case where another pkg wants to cache responses
- `memoise` seems close-ish but doesn't fit needs, e.g., no expiry, not specific
to HTTP requests, etc.
- we need something specific to HTTP requests, that allows expiration handling, a few different caching location options, works across HTTP clients, etc
- caching just the http responses means the rest of the code in the function can change, and the response can still be cached
    - the downside, vs. memoise, is that we're only caching the http response, so if there's still a lot of time spent processing the response, then the function will still be quite slow
- memoise is great, but since it caches the whole function call, you don't benefit from individually caching each http request, which we do here. if you cache each http request, then any time you do that same http request, it's response is already cached

### brainstorming

- use `webmockr` to match requests (works with `crul` and `httr`, maybe `curl` soon)
- possibly match on, and expire based on headers: Cache-Control, Age, Last-Modified,
ETag, Expires (see Ruby's faraday-http-cache (https://github.com/plataformatec/faraday-http-cache#what-gets-cached))
- caching backends: probably all binary to save disk space since most likely
we don't need users to be able to look at plain text of caches
- expiration: set a time to expire. if set to `2019-03-08 00:00:00` and it's
`2019-03-07 23:00:00`, then 1 hr from now the cache will expire, and a new real HTTP
request will need to be made (i.e., the cache will be deleted whenever the next
HTTP request is made)

### how though?

```{r}
library(webmiddens)
library(crul)
con <- crul::HttpClient$new("https://httpbin.org")
```

without webmiddens

```{r}
con$get(query = list(stuff = "bananas"))
```

with webmiddens, make a midden object first

```{r}
x <- midden$new()
x$init(path = "rainforest")
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
x$destroy()
```

first request is a real HTTP request

```{r}
x$call(con$get("get", query = list(stuff = "bananas")))
```

second request uses the cached response from the first request

```{r}
x$call(con$get("get", query = list(stuff = "bananas")))
```

list cached items

```{r}
x$cache$list()
# & cleanup
x$destroy()
```
